Hi there! I'm Raúl. I’m a Software Engineer, specializing in DevOps. Since I was a kid I was interested in computers, I wanted to know how they work. I feel like nowadays being able to understand how IT stuff work is like seeing some kind of magic not shown to the whole population. I'm pursuing that knowledge, and as taking that journey as a career. This is [my first personal website](https://www.raulriv.github.io/) where I'll be posting information on my professional career and any other interesting projects I do.
